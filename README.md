# Makeme.nvim
Detect the project Makefile and show all options on Telescope so the user can select them visually. It is a user friendly replacement for `:make myoption`

## This project is in conceptual phase!
Come back in a couple months.

## What is this
This plugin is gonna be similar to compiler.nvim, but it target users who prefer defining all their compiling options manually in a Makefile.

## Compatible with Compiler.nvim
Using the command `:CompilerRedo` must be able to interoperate with both plugins for a good user experience.
